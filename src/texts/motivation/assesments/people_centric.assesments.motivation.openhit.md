## people-centric
Healthcare is all about people, their relationships, quality of their lives and physical capacity. No one will be glad facing mechanistic or formalist approach to his or her life and wellbeing. Unfortunately HIT encourages such an attitude by formalizing and unifying the processes, cases and people communication. In major cases complex and uncomfortable HIT becomes an obstacle for healthcare professionals in performing their work. Besides, for most organizations in the industry HIT appears as one of the most considerable sources of additional cost with no clear additional value. At the same time a number of systems are immature, buggy and too complex for support.
