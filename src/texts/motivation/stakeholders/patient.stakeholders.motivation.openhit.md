A patient is one of the states of a person. At this state interest of a person as a stakeholder increases dramatically while he or her becomes an object of healthcare. A patient is concerned about velocity and quality of care as well as expenses taken. A patient is interested in control of actions and medicine and a psychological support.
There can be different types and statuses of patients. Each of these needs a personal approach.
