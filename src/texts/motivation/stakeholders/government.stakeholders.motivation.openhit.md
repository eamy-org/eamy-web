Government is one of the most powerful influencer on the healthcare industry. In most cases government is a main customer for HIT projects. On the one hand there is no real reason (except very blur political reasons) for government to implement and maintain large HIT systems. On the other hand, in many countries government is the biggest insurance provider and is interested in quantity and costs for medical support of citizens. Typically governmental structures are too large and variegated - each executive body department has its own goals, assessments and way of work.
