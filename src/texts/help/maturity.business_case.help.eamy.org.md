The maturity model described here is one of the main tools for a business case adoption. It is built around Manifesto Principles. Each principle can be found at one of the six levels of maturity. To assess the level of principle adoption one should refer to a principle implication section. You can assess current and desired level of the principles adoption maturity. Having done it you can adopt openHIT logical and technical architecture as well as capabilities for your particular case. This model is vendor and technology agnostic.
