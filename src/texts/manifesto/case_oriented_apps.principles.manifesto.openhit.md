**Principle**
User application should be adaptive to a certain  use case, process or situation. 

**Motivation**
In the majority of cases interaction of the users with the applications and information systems are too complex. Tools for the healthcare professionals are too complex, hard to learn and modify. Use of such tools steals a lot of working time of highly payed healthcare professionals and leads to poor results. That should help to simplify user interactions with the system. Dynamic applications allow user to adjust the application in the process of its use. It assumes that user or a semantic router tool on the fly can adjust the application. This is very useful for the situations with the rare diagnosis, special check-ups and observations and other use cases.

**Implications**
- application implementations should be as simple as possible
- application design should support extensions «on the fly»
