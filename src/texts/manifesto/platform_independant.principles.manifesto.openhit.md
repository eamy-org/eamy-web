**Principle**
HIT systems should be platform and technology independent.

**Motivation**
Only platform and technology independent solutions will allow to establish large-scale HIT systems that suit requirements and all needs of various stakeholders. Use of the open source SBBs linked with minimal requirements for the system deployment allowed to adjust the price of the solution and support for the clinics and low budget healthcare organizations.

**Implications**
- system components should have interaction capabilities based on widely used industry standards and techniques
- components of the system should be as small as possible
- components of the systems should be loosely coupled
- various deployment tools and capabilities
