**Principle**
Changes in standards of data should have minimum possible effect on systems capabilities or interactions.

**Motivation**
Implications of this principle will allow to avoid strong metadata coupling between services and domains and will help to achieve flexibility while processing redundant messages.

**Implications**
- rules for flexible standards should be defined in math terms.
- rules for flexible standards compliance evaluation against the needs of processing should be defined. 
- message processing services should process only known parts of the message
- special validation and compliance tools should be implemented as a part of a core system.
