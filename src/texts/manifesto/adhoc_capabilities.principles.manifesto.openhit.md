**Principle**
HIT should have tools for fast on-demand extension of the capabilities.

**Motivation**
Implementation of this principle will give the stakeholders and end-users greater agility in their work. Ad-hoc capabilities will allow stakeholders quickly adopt to the certain situation and specifics. Besides, it will allow  changing the approach for business processes and their optimization, gaining more control and agility in both internal and external interactions. It will significantly reduce time needed for adoption of business process to the particular needs or for launching a new one.

**Implications**
- fast and reliable deploy tools should be implemented as internal components of the system.
- to support full implementation of the capabilities system deploy tools should support services, applications and processes deployment and testing.
