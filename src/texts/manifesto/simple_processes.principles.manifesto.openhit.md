**Principle**
Processes should be as simple as possible.

**Motivation**
The process in healthcare are too complex - the only thing to handle it is to simplify it as well as it possible. Pipeline style processes help to implement a number of restrictions on the business processes and functions implementation which in one turn helped to simplify the processes and to order the badly (due to the bad regulatory) structured functions and processes in clinics.

**Implications**
- pipeline instead of common understanding of business process
- step-by-step execution of processes (it is quite a constraint for some types of the systems)
- pipelines should be 	extensible «on the fly»
- pipelines should be adaptive to the context of the message processing
