## Built-in security
**Principle**: HIT should have security means built-in the design of the systems and sufficient for effective data and system protection.
**Motivation**: Security is one of the major issues for the HIT. Low coupled security system (including SSO mechanisms, session keys, cryptography and special design of the deployment scheme) allows to incorporate special security tools and means combined with built-in security measures. That will allow to protect user data and system at every stage of system deployment, adoption and usage.
**Implications**:
- slots for additional security tools adoption in the overall systems design
- effective authentication and authorization
- effective roles regulation
- data protection against corruption
- cryptography for data in a wire and at rest
- session protection
- deployment (ephemeral ports, passwords protection, certificate management)
- system monitoring (penetration testing, network and system monitoring)
