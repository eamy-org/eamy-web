**Principle**
Applications should become means of healthcare professionalsâ€™ personal experience sharing and representation.

**Motivation**
Without the specialists who use their tools in everyday work it is not possible to build valuable applications. On the other hand, if developers will  follow directly the instructions of the healthcare specialist there will be no product as a result. Every healthcare specialist has his own view and comprehension of what is important and what is not. As can be seen from the above, the only meaningful way to achieve excellence with the healthcare applications is merely to unify the passion of the healthcare specialists and software developers. This is only possible if every healthcare specialist  has an opportunity to build (with the help of professional developers) his own application and present it to the community as a result of his vision and experience. Ideally such applications should become parts of scientific researches and publications - as a practical realization of methods of diagnostics and treatment.

**Implications**
- applications repository as a marketplace
- author rights protection at the marketplace
- easily understandable and simple application concept
- requirements and implementation guidelines
- flexible and reliable delivering and deployment system
