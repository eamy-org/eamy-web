**Principle**
The design of the system should provide clear definition and description of means used to support required level of compliance.

**Motivation**
For sure there are some constraints and liabilities connected with the use of HIT. These are regulatory, business and personal security concerns, commercial confidentiality and etc. Those should be dealt with the two major means. First one is  a principal design of the system which could help to avoid the problems with the adoption at all levels of implementation. Second one is the set of tools which could support the level of compliance needed for the certain judicial field or stakeholder. 

**Implications**
- systems should have tools for compliance check
- systems should support different tools for compliance assessment  with regards for the jurisdiction, location and  etc.
- systems should support fast adaptive processes
- systems should be loosely coupled
