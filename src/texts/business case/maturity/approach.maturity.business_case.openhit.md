## approach
### [?] two levels of maturity assessment
- first level is overall maturity assessment
- second level is detailed technical maturity assessment ?
 
- assess maturity for principles not technologies
- build business case based on maturity

### why?
- helps to avoid the mechanical approach to assessment
- helps to avoid ignorance to the customers needs and specifics of the business model
- helps to avoid obsession with technologies

### assessments
- **[disclaimer]** assessments were build based on openHIT motivation and manifesto - basically we are assessing the maturity of adoption of principles - not technologies or their implementations

- it is very important to remember that assessment of the organizations should not be formal as well as it should not be too generic. It is totally necessary to define the appropriate level of granularity while performing maturity assessment.
